# treeBranch
A jquery plugin that allows someone to access and process their profile's public information. 

## Notice:
> This jquery plugin is used, in combination with a PHP script, to access profile information that is not accessible with CORS and JASONP requests. Due to the nature of this script, I am being prudent and requesting that treehouse.com confirms that it is acceptable and within their TOS to use this in this method.

## Installation

```html
<script src="/path/to/treeBranch/jquery.treeBranch.js"></script>
```

Normally, the accompying php file that is used for the CORS bypass is kept within the treeBranch directory. You can move this to another directory if need be.
